# BITI IPM Lab - Icinga Template Library
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Before You Begin 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

The ITL is a collection of templates and check commands. Check commands control the invocation of plugins in Icinga 2.

A plugin is a program that uses its own logic to determine the status of a service or host. 

The check command to apply is specified in a service definition. This determines which plugin will be executed to perform a check on that service.

In this codelab you will learn

* how to use check commands

###  Where You Can Look Up

The best source of documentation is the homepage of Icinga2. The latest documentation can be found [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/).

### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian 11 (Bullseye).

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration. 

### Root privileges via sudo

In this codelab you have to work with root privileges. Therefore, a few words of caution: double check whatever you type and make backups whenever necessary.

Working with root privileges is quite easy. Open a terminal (a shell) and enter the following commmand:
```
sudo -s
```
Enter the password of the icinga user and voila:
```
root@server:/home/icinga#
```

Once you are root via sudo, it is no longer necessary to prepend the sudo command. Instead of `sudo ls -lisa /root/` you can also type `ls -lisa /root/` because you have root privileges already. However, all commands in this codelab will always start with `sudo` to remind you that you are working with root privileges.

## Icinga Template Library

### Introduction

The documentation of the ITL can be found [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/10-icinga-template-library/#plugin-check-commands-for-monitoring-plugins).

The documentation provides an overview of subsets of templates and object definitions.

![Icinga Web 2 Director](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-itl-1.png)

As an example, scroll down to the `check_user` plugin.

![Icinga Web 2 Director](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-itl-2.png)

This section gives you a short description of the `check_users` plugin. Here, the `check_users` plugin checks the number of users currently logged in on the local system and generates an error if the number exceeds the thresholds specified. The plugin accepts parameters which can be accessed as runtime macros by the executed command.

The check_users plugin provides the following parameters:
* users_wgreater - Optional. The user count warning threshold. Defaults to 20.
* users_cgreater - Optional. The user count critical threshold. Defaults to 50.


## CommandLine

When you install Icinga on your computer, all check commands can be found in `/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/`.

To get an overview of the plugin and its parameters, please run the following command:
```
sudo /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_users -h
```

The plugin provides a detailed help screen.
```
check_users v2.3.1 (monitoring-plugins 2.3.1)
Copyright (c) 1999 Ethan Galstad
Copyright (c) 2000-2007 Monitoring Plugins Development Team
	<devel@monitoring-plugins.org>

This plugin checks the number of users currently logged in on the local
system and generates an error if the number exceeds the thresholds specified.


Usage:
check_users -w <users> -c <users>

Options:
 -h, --help
    Print detailed help screen
 -V, --version
    Print version information
 --extra-opts=[section][@file]
    Read options from an ini file. See
    https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/extra-opts.html
    for usage and examples.
 -w, --warning=INTEGER
    Set WARNING status if more than INTEGER users are logged in
 -c, --critical=INTEGER
    Set CRITICAL status if more than INTEGER users are logged in

Send email to help@monitoring-plugins.org if you have questions regarding
use of this software. To submit patches or suggest improvements, send email
to devel@monitoring-plugins.org
```

The check the number of users logged in, run the following command:

```
sudo /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_users -w 0 -c 0
```

Note that you have to pass here all parameters here. The output command will look as follows:
```
USERS CRITICAL - 1 users currently logged in | users=1;0;0;0
```
As expected, the plugin generates a critical message because the number of logged-in users exceeds the threshold of zero (0). Use different thresholds to generate CRITICAL, WARNING and OK messages.

<aside class="positive">
It is a good practice to test check_commands on the command line first. This helps the Icinga administrator understand how check_commands must be used and how they are defined and applied in configuration files.
</aside>


## Services

In a next step, we will extend the `check_user` plugin in our service definition.
Open the `services.config` file with an editor of your choice (here nano).

```
sudo nano /etc/icinga2/zones.d/master/services.conf
```


Scroll down to the `Users` Service and add the following line:
```
apply Service "Users" {
  check_command = "users"
  command_endpoint = host.vars.client_endpoint
  vars.users_wgreater = 0  <=== ADD THIS
  assign where host.vars.client_endpoint
}
```

Now restart the Icinga2 service to apply the changes

```
sudo systemctl restart icinga2
```

<aside class="negative">
Do you encounter any problems? Try to fix it!
</aside>


Now go back to the Icinga2 Web Interface and check if User problems occur:
![Icinga Web 2 Director](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-itl-3.png)

If not, log in to Icinga node client via Console or via SSH. After a couple of minutes, the following service problem shows up on the screen.

![Icinga Web 2 Director](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-itl-4.png)

In this case, the agent on the node client has identitied the two users who are currently logged in and generated a WARNING status. The message disappears as soon as all users have logged out again.

![Icinga Web 2 Director](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-itl-5.png)

However, all past incidents are stored within Icinga2 and can be retrieved at any time. Just click on `Users` in the section "Recently Recovered Services", then select the `History` tab.

## Hands-on

### What you will learn:

This Hands-on differs from other lessons. This Hands-on wants you to explore some of the check_commands which are provided by Icinga2 per default.

In this codelab, you will learn 

* how to use more check commands on the command line
* how to use them as services
* how useful backups are!
* 

The objective of this hands-on is to get some practice when working with Icinga2 and its configuration files.

### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need a running Icinga2 server.

### The assignment

* Go to `/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/` and pick some random check_commands.
* Run them on the commandline first to get an idea how they work and what parameters they provide.
* Edit the files `/etc/icinga2/zones.d/master/services.conf` (agendbased) and `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/localhost.conf` (agentless) and add some of the check_commands. Finally, update some parameters of existing commands.
* Watch how Icinga2 reacts on the changes you made and play around with different settings.

### Useful check_commands

Here is a list of some checks you might test:

* check_mysql (localhost only because the database is installed on your Icinga2 server)
* check_apt (can be installed on both, localhost and node)
* check_http (let's go and check some external websites)
* check_procs (can be installed on both, localhost and node)
* check_tcp (hmmm, which service is waiting for incoming tcp traffic?)
* check_swap (already installed so have fun with different parameters)
* check_disk (already installed so have fun with different parameters)

And much much more. Have fun!

## Cleanup

Congratulations !

You have successfully implemented some ITL plugins.
