# BITI IPM Lab - Disk
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Before You Begin 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

A hard disk is the storage medium in your computer. A hard disk drive (HDD) is a traditional storage device that uses mechanical platters and a moving read/write head to access data. A solid state drive (SSD) is a newer, faster type of device that stores data on instantly-accessible memory chips.

In this codelab you will learn how to identify HDDs and SDDS in your computer and how to measure their performance. 


###  Where You Can Look Up
The **man** is a short term for manual page and acts as an interface to view the reference manual of a command.

Syntax of man:
```
man [option(s)] keyword(s)
```

For example, if you want top find out more about the command **ps** and how to use it, just open a shell and type:
```
man ps
```

This command will display all the information about **ps**.
```
PS(1)                            User Commands                           PS(1)

NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.
...
...
```
### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian 11 (Bullseye) or Microsoft Windows.

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration. 

## Display Disk information on Linux

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find detailed information about the physical disks on Linux:

* lshw 
* inxi
* smartctl 

### #1. The lshw command 

The **lshw** (Hardware Lister) is a simple, yet full-featured tool that provides detailed information on the hardware configuration. It can report memory configuration, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, Hard disk drive details, cache configuration, bus speed and a lot more. **lshw** requires root privileges. 

Open a shell and run the following command:
```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Sample output:
```
root@server:~# lshw -class disk
  *-cdrom                   
       description: DVD reader
       product: CD-ROM
       vendor: VBOX
       physical id: 0.0.0
       bus info: scsi@2:0.0.0
       logical name: /dev/cdrom
       logical name: /dev/dvd
       logical name: /dev/sr0
       version: 1.0
       capabilities: removable audio dvd
       configuration: ansiversion=5 status=ready
     *-medium
          physical id: 0
          logical name: /dev/cdrom
  *-disk
       description: ATA Disk
       product: VBOX HARDDISK
       vendor: VirtualBox
       physical id: 0.0.0
       bus info: scsi@1:0.0.0
       logical name: /dev/sda
       version: 1.0
       serial: VB7b3622bd-ddc6a90c
       size: 24GiB (25GB)
       capabilities: partitioned partitioned:dos
       configuration: ansiversion=5 logicalsectorsize=512 sectorsize=512 signature=826474aa
```

<aside class="positive">
The lshw tool provides also information about Memory, CPU, and more in a very user-friendly format. Consult the documentation and man-pages for more details. Try to identify keywords and details of the disk and other components. 
</aside>

To  display only the name of the disks, run:
Sample output:
```
root@server:~# lshw -short -class disk
```

The `-short` option is useful when you need the name of the drives only (here: /dev/cdrom or /dev/sda).

Sample output:
```
root@server:~# lshw -short -class disk
H/W path            Device      Class       Description
=======================================================
/0/100/1.1/0.0.0    /dev/cdrom  disk        CD-ROM
/0/100/1.1/0.0.0/0  /dev/cdrom  disk        
/0/100/d/0.0.0      /dev/sda    disk        25GB VBOX HARDDISK
```

### #2. The inxi command

Inxi is yet another full-featured command line system information tool. It shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of other useful information.

To get the details of the installed hard disk drives in your Linux system, run the following command:
```
inxi -D
```

Information is grouped per memory device. That means that every memory device is listed separately and various details about the memory are included in the description. 

Sample output:
```
root@server:~# inxi -D
Drives:    Local Storage: total: 24 GiB used: 13.57 GiB (56.5%) 
           ID-1: /dev/sda vendor: VirtualBox model: VBOX HARDDISK size: 24 GiB 
```

<aside class="positive">
Consult the documentation and man-pages for more details. Try to identify keywords and details of the disk. 
</aside>

You can also display more disk details like disk controller speed, serial no and temperature using the following command:
```
inxi -Dxx
```

Sample output:
```
root@server:~# inxi -Dxx
Drives:    Local Storage: total: 24 GiB used: 13.57 GiB (56.5%) 
           ID-1: /dev/sda vendor: VirtualBox model: VBOX HARDDISK size: 24 GiB speed: 3.0 Gb/s serial: VB7b3622bd-ddc6a90c 
```

<aside class="positive">
Be aware that all commands are executed within a virtual machine. Running the tool on physical hardware provides more information. 
</aside>

### #3. The smartctl command

**Smartclt** is a command line, control and monitor utility for SMART disks. It controls the **S**elf-**M**onitoring, **A**nalysis and **R**eporting **T**echnology (SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS hard drives and solid-state drives. 

**Smartclt** command is part of the **smartmontools** package, which comes pre-installed in most Linux versions. 
**Smartclt** requires root privileges.


To get all details about the first hard disk drive (dev/sda) in your Linux box, run **Smartclt** the following options:
```
sudo smartctl -d ata -a -i /dev/sda
```

Sample output:
```

## Disk monitoring tools on Linux

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following command to monitor disks on Linux:

* iotop
* dstat

### #1. The iotop command

**iotop** is a top-like utility for displaying real-time disk activity. By using **iotop** command, you can monitor the disk utilization by individual processes.

Here is a quick example:
```
iotop -o
```
The `-o` or  `--only` option presents only processes or threads actually doing I/O.

Sample output:
![Exercise](./img/biti-ipm-disk-linux-iotop.png) 

The **iotop** command displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and written by each process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays the percentage of time the thread/process spent while swapping in and while waiting on I/O. For each process, its I/O priority (class/level) is shown. In addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during the sampling period is displayed at the top of the interface.

<aside class="positive">
Consult the documentation and man-pages for more details. 
</aside>

### #2. The dstat command

The **dstat** tool is used to retrieve information or statistics form components of the system such as network connections, IO devices, or CPU. By using this tool a system administrator can even see the throughput for block devices that make up a single filesystem or storage system. 

Open a shell and run **dtat** without any option to see major OS components:
```
dstat
```

Sample output:
```
root@server:~# dstat
You did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.
--total-cpu-usage-- -dsk/total- -net/total- ---paging-- ---system--

```

This command will display CPU, Disk, Network, Paging and System stats. 
The output above indicates:

* CPU stats: cpu usage by a user (usr) processes, system (sys) processes, as well as the number of idle (idl) and waiting (wai) processes, hard interrupt (hiq) and soft interrupt (siq).
* Disk stats: total number of read (read) and write (writ) operations on disks.
* Network stats: total amount of bytes received (recv) and sent (send) on network interfaces.
* Paging stats: number of times information is copied into (in) and moved out (out) of memory.
* System stats: number of interrupts (int) and context switches (csw). A CSW is a process that involves switching of the CPU from one process or task to another.

<aside class="positive">
Consult the documentation and man pages for more details. Try to identify keywords and details not only of the memory, but also the details about processes, I/O and more. 
</aside>


Additionally, you can also store the output of dstat in a CSV file for analysis at a latter time by enabling the `--output` option.

By running **dstat** with the following options, we are displaying the time, cpu, mem, disk, and system load statistics with a one second delay between 5 updates (counts).

```
dstat --time --cpu --mem disk --load --output report.csv 1 5
```

Sample output:
```
----system---- --total-cpu-usage-- ------memory-usage----- -dsk/total- ---load-avg---

### Scenario

In this codelab, the GuestOS is a Virtual Machine with 2 CPU Cores and 4 GB RAM. The GuestOS is based on Debian 11.0 (Bullseye) with Linux kernel version 5.10.0-8-amd64. The VM is installed and running on the Linux-based Hypervisor VirtualBox, Version 6.1.16 r140961 (QT 5.11.3). THe HostOS is based on Debian 10 (Buster) with Linux Kernel version 4.19.0-17-amd64. The Host hardware is HP Prodesk 400 G1 DN with a Intel Core i3-4160T CPU@3.10GHz, 16GB RAM, and an Intenso SATA III Top 512GB.

### Test Run

* Open a shell terminal and execute the following command:
```
dstat --time --cpu --mem disk --load --output report.csv 1 5
```

* Open the second shell terminal and start the workload generator with the following option.
```
stress --hdd 2 --io 4 --vm 6 --cpu 8 --timeout 30s
```

Where, 
* --hdd 2 -  This will start a 2-thread test, which will write data to the storage and delete it.
* --io 4 -  This will start a 4-thread test, which will stress the system' storage read and write buffers
* --vm 6 -  This will start a 6-thread test, running malloc() and free() functions
* --cpu 4 - This will start a 8-thread test, running sqrt()) functions

Notice that the workload generator runs with a time limit of 30 seconds. Afterwards, open the report.csv file and analyse the results within your team.

## Display CPU information on Microsoft Windows

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find some information about the physical CPUs (pCPU) including all cores on Windows:

* msinfo32 application

### #1. The msinfo32 application
The tool **msinfo32** is a built-in system profiler for Microsoft Windows which collects and displays system information about the the Operating systems, hard- and software.

To launch **msinfo32**, simple press the **Win+R** keys, type **msinfo32** and click the **OK**-button.

![Windows Registry](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-msinfo32-disk.png)

Details about the Disks can be found in the **Components -> Storage** Section at the **Disks** value in the right pane.



## Hands-on: Disk Monitoring on Windows

Application performance often depends on how well and quickly storage systems can be provisioned to end users. Storage performance is usually an important factor in the deployment of an application. For this reason, the appropriate storage system must be evaluated, designed and selected in terms of IOPS as well as throughput, speed and bandwidth.

The following section describes the Microsoft tool Diskspd.exe for evaluating the performance of disk and storage systems.
### What you will learn:

In this codelab, you will learn 

* how to generate workload with the diskspd.exe tool

### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need the following tools:

* diskspd.exe


### The diskspd.exe command

The free Microsoft tool called [Diskspd.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/diskspd/releases) measures the performance of a storage system for Windows, Windows Server and Cloud Server infrastructure at Microsoft Azure and simulates various application loads. Values are given in IOPS, or Input/Output Operations per Second, and provide a benchmark for performance. Please visit the following [page](https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd/wiki) for updated documentation.

For applications such as Microsoft Exchange or SQL Server, it may be necessary to determine the performance of the storage system in advance, The results help Administrators to specify the required Read/Write performance including latency.

The program can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/microsoft/diskspd/releases)) and copied to any directory on the target server.  The zipfile contains several versions, including a 64-bit variant in the amd64 folder. If you need a graphical user interface instead of the console window, you can get the Diskspd GUI from the [DiskSpeed](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DiskSpeed-90d37d55) project.

To use the tool on the console, open a command prompt with **administrator rights** and then navigate to the directory where you copied and unpacked the zipfile. Finally go to the subdirectory corresponding to your target architecture (e.g. amd64).

### Scenario

In this codelab, the target is a virtual Machine with 2 CPU Cores and 8 GB RAM. The operating system is based on Windows 10 Educatuinm Version 10,0,19042 Build 19042. The VM is installed and running on the Linux-based Hypervisor VirtualBox, Version 6,1.16 r140961 (QT 5.11.3). THe HostOS is based on Debian 10 with Linux Kernel version 4.19.0-17-amd64. The Host hardware is HP Prodesk 400 G1 DN with a Intel Core i3-4160T CPU@3.10GHz, 16GB RAM, and an Intenso SATA III Top 512GB.

### Test Run

This Run is based on the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) workload, which involves high levels of write activity. 
#### SQL Server OLTP

Open a Powershell terminal as Administrator and execute disksdo.exe with the following options:

```
diskspd.exe -b8K -d180 -h -L -o32 -t3 -r -w75 -c5G sqldata.dat > result.txt
```

Where, 
* -b - Block size of the input/output, specified as (K/M/G). For example, -b8K means a block size of 8 KB, which is relevant for SQL Server.
* -d - Test duration in seconds. Tests of 30-60 seconds are usually long enough to get valid results. Here, test duration is defined with 180 seconds.
* -h - Disables operating system-level software caching and hardware write caching. Here it is disabled becauseSQL Server works this way.
* -L - Captures latency information during the test
* -o - Pending I/Os (i.e. queue depth) per target, per worker thread.
* -t - worker threads per test file target. Here it is defined with 3 workers.
* -r - If the -r option is used, random tests are performed, otherwise sequential tests are performed. Here, SQL Server accesses data files randomly.
* -w - Specifies the percentage. For example, -w75 means that 75% write and 25% read operations are performed. Here, value is set to 75 because OLTP workloads involves more writung activities than reading.
* sqldata.at - the sample sql file name that will be used in the test. 
* -c -Creates workload file(s) of the specified size, specified as (K/M/G).
* - result.txt - the output file of the test results

After the execution of the test, the results are written to the file named **result.txt**. The results of the test are divided into 5 sections. The first section of the test result shows us the input parameters and all other settings.

```
