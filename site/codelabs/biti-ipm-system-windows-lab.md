# BITI IPM Lab - System Information
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Before You Begin 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this codelab you will learn

* how to get system information with systeminfo

###  Where You Can Look Up

### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Microsoft Windows.

<aside class="negative">
Important note: All codelabs for Microsoft Windows are tested on Windows 10 but should also work on Windows 11. 
</aside>

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration.
