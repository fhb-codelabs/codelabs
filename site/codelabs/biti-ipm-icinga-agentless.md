# BITI IPM Lab - Icinga Agentless Monitoring

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Before You Begin

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

Hosts and services can be monitored in two ways:

- **Use of Simple Host Monitoring (Agentless):** This involves the use of services that are accessible across the local network or the Internet for example include HTTP, SSH, ICMP etc. This method is fit for monitoring hosts on which monitoring agents cannot be installed.

- **Use of Monitoring Agents (Agentbased):** In this method, an agent is required in order to monitor host and services like CPU load, disk space, memory and the running process. In this configuration, Icinga 2 acts as the master node and the remote host acts as the client node.

In this codelab you will learn

- how to monitor the availability (=state) of hosts and services agentless with Icinga2

Hosts and services can be anything such as Network services (HTTP, SSH, etc.), printers, switches or routers, or any other local or network-accessible services. Icinga2 monitors the states of hosts and the services they offer. Each host can have the states UP and DOWN, each service can have the states OKAY, WARNING, CRITICAL and UKNOWN.

### Where You Can Look Up

The best source of documentation is the homepage of Icinga2. The latest documentation can be found [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/).

### What You'll need

#### Icinga2 instance

You need a working Icinga2 instance that you can access via IcingaWeb2 GUI. If you do not have a running Icinga2 instance, please consult the Codelab **BITI IPM Lab - Icinga Installation** how to install Icinga2 on your local computer.

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian .

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration.

### Root privileges via sudo

In this codelab you have to work with root privileges. Therefore, a few words of caution: double check whatever you type and make backups whenever necessary.

Working with root privileges is quite easy. Open a terminal (a shell) and enter the following commmand:

```
sudo -s
```

Enter the password of the icinga user and voila:

```
root@server:/home/icinga#
```

Once you are root via sudo, it is no longer necessary to prepend the sudo command. Instead of `sudo ls -lisa /root/` you can also type `ls -lisa /root/` because you have root privileges already. However, all commands in this codelab will always start with `sudo` to remind you that you are working with root privileges.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Backup configuration

### Stop Icinga2 service

In this codelab we need to reconfigure Icinga2. First, stop the Icinga2 service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl stop icinga2
```

Next, check the status of the service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl status icinga2
```

The output should look as this:

```
  icinga2.service - Icinga host/service/network monitoring system
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/icinga2.service; enabled; vendor prese>

```

Note that the status `Active` must be `inactive (dead) since XXXXXX`. Press `q` to end the output.

### Config.d directory

The basic Icinga2 installation provides sample files for monitoring the local server. All files can be found in the following directory:

```
sudo ls -al /etc/icinga2/conf.d/
```

The `ls -al` command displays the following configuration files in detail:

```
drwxr-x--- 2 root   root   4096 Dec  7 14:15 .
drwxr-x--- 9 nagios nagios 4096 Dec  7 14:19 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     35 Dec  7 14:15 app.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    114 Dec  7 14:15 apt.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   5297 Dec  7 14:15 commands.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    542 Dec  7 14:15 downtimes.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    638 Dec  7 14:15 groups.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   1500 Dec  7 14:15 hosts.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    793 Dec  7 14:15 notifications.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   2131 Dec  7 14:15 services.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   2060 Dec  7 14:15 templates.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    732 Dec  7 14:15 timeperiods.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root    308 Dec  7 14:15 users.conf
```

The samples can be very helpful if you want to gain an insight into the structure of the configuration files. However, as we want to set up our own files here, the sample files are not required for our codelab. Let's start from scratch.

### How to backup

The easiest way is to move the configuration files to another folder. Run the following commands to backup the Icinga2 config files:

```
sudo cd /etc/icinga2
sudo mv conf.d/ conf.d.backup/
sudo mkdir conf.d/
sudo chown -R nagios:nagios conf.d
```

To summarize, the sequence simply renames the source directory (conf.d -> conf.d.backup) and creates a new directory (conf.d). Finally, the ownership of the user `nagios` is completely transferred to the `config.d` directory. This will be our working directory from now on. All sample files are now in the backup directory and can be restored if required. You can check this with the following command:

```
root@server:/etc/icinga2/conf.d# sudo ls -la /etc/icinga2/conf.d.backup/
total 56
drwxr-x--- 2 root   root   4096 Dec  7 14:15 .
drwxr-x--- 9 nagios nagios 4096 Dec  7 14:19 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios   35 Dec  7 14:15 app.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  114 Dec  7 14:15 apt.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 5297 Dec  7 14:15 commands.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  542 Dec  7 14:15 downtimes.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  638 Dec  7 14:15 groups.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 1500 Dec  7 14:15 hosts.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  793 Dec  7 14:15 notifications.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 2131 Dec  7 14:15 services.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 2060 Dec  7 14:15 templates.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  732 Dec  7 14:15 timeperiods.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  308 Dec  7 14:15 users.conf
```

In the next section, we can now create our own configuration structure. Follow me.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Create template files

First, we create two template files: a host and a service template. Template files contain basic settings and can be imported by provided configuration files.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

### templates.conf

The `templates.conf` file contains basic settings for monitoring hosts (e.g. servers) and services (e.g. HTTP service, SSH service).

First, create an empty file with the corresponding ownership:

```
sudo touch /etc/icinga2/conf.d/templates.conf
sudo chown nagios:nagios /etc/icinga2/conf.d/templates.conf
```

Next, open the file with an editor:

```
sudo nano /etc/icinga2/conf.d/templates.conf
```

Next, copy the following content in to the template file:

```
template Host "generic-host" {
  max_check_attempts = 3
  check_interval = 5m
  retry_interval = 150s
}

template Service "generic-service" {
  max_check_attempts = 3
  check_interval = 1m
  retry_interval = 30s
}
```

Where,

- `template` - the key word
- `Host` or `Service` - template type (type can be Host, Service, User, Period, etc.)
- `generic-host` or `generic-service` - one unique name for each template section
- `max_check_attempts` - specifies how often a check may fail before a reaction is triggered
- `check_interval` - specifies after how many minutes/seconds a check should be repeated if no failures occur
- `retry_interval` -specifies after how many minutes/seconds a check should be repeated if failures occur

<aside class="positive">
Note that you can change the values for max_check_attempts, check_interval and retry_interval according to your specifications. Again, the templates.conf specifies basic settings. Therefore, the basic settings can always be overwritten in the hosts and/or services files.
</aside>

Quit the configuration file with `CTRL-X` and confirm with `y` to save all changes.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Create commands file

### Commands.conf

The file `commands.conf` contains information on how check_commands are triggered by Icinga2. Since Icinga2 has a lot of check_commands, simply restore the commands.conf file from the backup directory and we are done here.

```
sudo cp /etc/icinga2/conf.d.backup/commands.conf /etc/icinga2/conf.d/commands.conf
sudo chown -R nagios:nagios /etc/icinga2/conf.d
```

### Check for completeness

At this point, let's see what we have. Run the following command:

```
sudo ls -al /etc/icinga2/conf.d/
```

The output must look like this:

```
total 24
drwxr-x--- 2 root   root   4096 Dec  7 14:15 .
drwxr-x--- 9 nagios nagios 4096 Dec  7 14:19 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 5297 Dec  7 14:15 commands.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios 2060 Dec  7 14:15 templates.conf
```

Check whether the files `commands.conf` and `templates.conf` exist. If not, delete everything in this directory and start again from the beginning.

## Create hosts file

The `hosts.conf` file defines the configuration for all monitored hosts and servers. However, managing all hosts in a single file is difficult to maintain. For this, we will create a new folder in which we will define several config files.

For this codelab, we will create the following host files:

- `localhost.conf` - the GuestOS
- `host_os.conf` - the HostOS

Note that we will not install monitoring agents on the HostOS system (e.g. your PC or laptop). Instead, we use a simple approach to monitor the HostOS system, better known as **Agentless Monitoring**. This approach is used when the installation of agents on the target system is not possible.

### localhost.conf

We start by monitoring our GuestOS system `localhost`. 

First, create the directory for our hosts.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/
```

Next, create the file `localhost.conf`.

```
sudo touch /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/localhost.conf
```

Next, open the file with an editor of your choice (here: nano):

```
sudo nano /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/localhost.conf
```

Next, copy the following content:

```
object Host "localhost"{
  import  "generic-host"
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  check_command = "hostalive"
}

object Service "ping4" {
  import  "generic-service"
  host_name = "localhost"
  check_command = "ping4"
}

object Service "swap"{
  import  "generic-service"
  host_name = "localhost"
  check_command = "swap"
}

object Service "load"{
  import  "generic-service"
  host_name = "localhost"
  check_command = "load"
}

object Service "ssh"{
  import  "generic-service"
  host_name = "localhost"
  check_command = "ssh"
}
```

Let's stop here to analyze the content:

```
object Host "localhost"{
  import  "generic-host"
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  check_command = "hostalive"
}
```

In this section we define a host object with the name `localhost` (to keep it simple). This is our target host. This object imports the `generic-host` template (which we created earlier) with all the default settings. We also specify the IP address of our target host. Since we plan to monitor our local machine, we simply use the IP address of the loopback device (127.0.0.1). Finally, we define the first check command (here: hostalive).

<aside class="positive">
The hostalive command is one of several built-in check commands. It sends ICMP echo requests to the IP address specified in the address attribute to determine whether a host is online.
</aside>

The example above also creates four (4) services: ping4, swap, load and ssh. All services refer to the target host `localhost`. Each service also specifies the corresponding check commands such as `ssh` or `load` which is triggered by Icinga2.

So far, so good ?

Exit the editor with `CTRL-X`. Confirm with `y` to save all changes.

### host_os.conf

This section shows you how to monitor your HostOS system without using monitoring agents.

We use the same directory structure (/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/) as in the previous section. 

First, create the file `host_os.conf`.

```
sudo touch /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf
```

Next, open the file with an editor:

```
sudo nano /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf
```

Next, copy the following content in to the `host_os.conf` file:

```
object Host "host_os"{
  import  "generic-host"
  address "<ip-address of the hostos>"
  check_command = "hostalive"
}

object Service "ping4" {
  import  "generic-service"
  host_name = "host_os"
  check_command = "ping4"
}

```

In this section we define a host object with the name `host_os` (to keep it simple). This is our remote target host. This object imports the `generic-host` template (which we created earlier) with all the default settings. We also specify the IP address of our target host. Since we plan to monitor a remote machine, we simply use the IP address of your HostOS (e.g. your laptop). Finally, we define the first check command (here: hostalive).

<aside class="positive">
Remember: your HostOS is your hardware device.
</aside>

The example above also defines a `ping4` services which refers to the target host `host_os`. This service also specifies the corresponding check command which is triggered by Icinga2.

So far, so good ?

Exit the editor with `CTRL-X`. Confirm with `y` to save all changes.

Finally, transfer the ownership to all files and subdirs:
```
sudo chown -R nagios:nagios /etc/icinga2/conf.d
```

### Check for completeness

Let's see what we have so far. Run the following list command:

```
sudo ls -al /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/
```

The output must look like this:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Dec  8 20:59 .
drwxr-x--- 3 nagios nagios 4096 Dec  8 20:59 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  196 Dec  8 20:59 host_os.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 nagios nagios  440 Dec  8 20:58 localhost.conf
```

Check whether the files `host_os.conf` and `localhost.conf` exist and all owwerships are set correctly. If not, delete everything in this directory and start again from the beginning.


## Test and restart

### Test the configuration

Before restarting the Icinga2 service, it is a good idea to validate the configuration files. We can do this with the following command:

```
sudo icinga2 daemon -C
```

The parameter `-C` checks the config and issues an error message if the syntax is incorrect. Here's an example:

```
[2021-12-03 15:49:12 +0100] information/cli: Icinga application loader (version: r2.12.3-1)
[2021-12-03 15:49:12 +0100] information/cli: Loading configuration file(s).
[2021-12-03 15:49:12 +0100] critical/config: Error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING
Location: in /etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/hostos.conf: 3:11-3:25
/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf(1): object Host "host_os" {
/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf(2):   import "generic-host"
/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf(3):   address "192.168.0.188"
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf(4):   check_command = "hostalive"
/etc/icinga2/conf.d/hosts/host_os.conf(5): }

[2021-12-03 15:49:12 +0100] critical/cli: Config validation failed. Re-run with 'icinga2 daemon -C' after fixing the config.
```

The output shows that there is an error in the file **host_os.conf**. The line 3 is marked with wavy line, indicating that something is wrong here. Experts like you immediately recognize that the equal sign (=) between the string **address** and **192.168.0.188** is missing. After fixing this typo (sorry for that), lets run the command again:

```
sudo icinga2 daemon -C
```

The output now lists an overview of all configuration files and instantiated configuration items, indicating that we are fine here.

```
[2021-12-03 15:48:00 +0100] information/cli: Icinga application loader (version: r2.12.3-1)

[2021-12-03 15:48:01 +0100] information/cli: Finished validating the configuration file(s).
```

Perfect! Now we want to test our configuration in practice.

### Start Icinga2 service

First, start Icinga2 service with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start icinga2
```

Next, check the service status:

```
sudo systemctl status icinga2
```

Sample output:

```

Note that the status must be `active (running)`, indicating that the service is up and running.

## Icinga Web 2

Let's go back to the Icinga Web frontend. You will notice that some check commands are in pending mode. Don't worry about that. Icinga2 needs some time to process the results of the check commands. 

Meanwhile, discover the dashboard: (1) Service problems (2) Host problems and (3) Recently Recovered Services. Depending on the status, noticifations are listed in one of the three layout cards.

![Icinga Web 2](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-agentless-1.png)

After some time, more and more messages are listed in the "Recently restored services" card.

![Icinga Web 2](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-agentless-2.png)

Finally, all hosts and services operate in normal state. No service or host problems occur.

![Icinga Web 2](./img/biti-ipm-icinga-agentless-3.png)

Perfect! 

## Cleanup

Congratulations !

You have successfully set up your first host for agentless monitoring with standard CheckCommands.
