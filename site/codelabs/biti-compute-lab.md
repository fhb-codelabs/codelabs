# BITI IPM Lab 1 - How to monitor CPU Usage
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
Every computer system benefits from proper administration and monitoring. A computer operates more quickly if few CPU-intensive processes are running at the same time.
Consequently, it makes sense that administrators check the CPU usage on a regular basis to identify programs that unnecessarly burden the system.

There are plenty of command line utilities created for this purpose. This codelab will introduce you to some of the most helpful applications, how to install and use them.

## Documentation
### Man-Pages
The **man** is a short term for manual page and acts as an interface to view the reference manual of a command.

Syntax of man:
```
man [option(s)] keyword(s)
```

For example, if you want top find out more about the command **ps** and how to use it, just open a shell and type:
```
man ps
```

This command will display all the information about **ps**.
```
PS(1)                            User Commands                           PS(1)

NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.

```
## Prerequisities
### Root privileges

Installing additional software from Debian repositories requires root privileges. There are three ways how to get root access.

1. Log in as root
```
Debian GNU/Linux 11 icinga tty1

icinga login: _
```

2. When logged in as regular user, open the shell and run the following command:
```
su - 
```

3. When you are logged in as regular user and if you are a member of the **sudo** group, then open the shell and run the following command:
```
sudo -s
```

<aside class="positive">
Note:<br>
1. Typically, you will be prompted for the root password. If unknown, ask your instructor for the password and run the above command again.<br>
2. Modern Linux distributions disable the login for the root user. In this case, log in as regular user. Afterwards, use the ''su -'' or the ''sudo -s'' command. Good luck! 
</aside>


### Man-Pages

## Display CPU Information

### nproc
The **nproc** command displays the number of available processing units. The command is a built-in command in a Linux system.

Open a shell and run **nproc** with the following option:
```
nproc --all
```

The output should look like this:
```
4
```

<aside class="positive">
Without the --all flag, nproc will display the number of processing units available to the current process.<br>
Use the --help flag for more information.
</aside>


### lscpu

On most Linux distributions, you can also use the **lscpu** command. It displays not only the number of processors but also the architecture, model name, speed, much more.

Open a shell and run the following command:
```
lscpu
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
```

```

## Monitor the CPU

### uptime
The command **uptime** shows the basic information. The tool requires few system resources only and can be helpful when a system is responding slow.


Open a shell  and run the command as follows:
```
uptime
```

The output may look like this:
```
17:58:21 up 1 day, 22:38,  1 user,  load average: 0.54, 0.51, 0.69
```

The command shows :

- the system time at the moment the command was run (here: 5.58pm)
- how long the server had been running (here: 1 day)
- how many connections users had to the machine (here: 1 user)
- the CPU load average for the past one, five, and fifteen minutes (here: 0.54, 0.51, 0.69)

<aside class="positive">
Consult your documentation about the CPU load average, its meaning and how to interpret the numbers.
</aside>


### top

One of the most common tools for checking the CPU utilization is **top**. <br><br>
Like **uptime**, the command **top** displays the CPU load averages. In addition, the command provides real-time CPU usage information as well as other performance metrics. Furthermore, top stays in the foreground and refreshes at regular intervals.

Run the **top** command as follows:
```
top
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
![top](./img/biti-ipm-compute-top.png)

The first five lines (also called the Header Block) provide a summary about the processes on the server. The Header Block is followed by a table  (the Process Table) with information about each individual process.

<aside class="positive">
Consult the man-pages for more details about top, about the Header Block and the Process Table. Run your own research about the output and how to interpret it.
</aside>

### htop

This tool is another interactive real-time process monitoring application. It has numerous nice user-friendly features which are not availble under the **top** command.

Unfortunately, the program is not installed by default. Run the following command to install **htop** with the privileges of the root account:
```
apt update; apt install htop
```

<aside class="positive">
If errors occur due to lack of root privilegues, check the section Prerequisites for more details. 
</aside>


After successful installation, run the **htop** command as follows:
```
htop
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
![htop](./img/biti-ipm-compute-htop.png)

The top section is more easier to read and the bottom section is better organized.


<aside class="positive">
Consult the man-pages for more details about htop. Run your own research about the output and how to interpret it.
</aside>


### mpstat

The tool **mpstat** is a command that is used to report processor related statistics. It displays the statistics of the CPU usage of the system and information about CPU utilization. It initializes the first processor with CPU 0, the second one with CPU 1, and so on.


The tool **mpstat** is part of the software package **sysstat**. Like **htop**, the program is not installed by default. Run the following command to install the **systat** package with the privileges of the root account:
```
apt update; apt install sysstat
```

<aside class="positive">
If errors occur, execute the command **su -** first before running the installation process. You will be prompted for the root password. Ask your instructor for the password and run the above command again. 
</aside>


After successful installation, run the **mpstat** command as follows:
```
mpstat
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
```
Linux 5.10.0-8-amd64 (debian)   07/21/2021      _x86_64_        (2 CPU)

10:13:59 AM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal  %guest  %gnice   %idle
10:13:59 AM  all    7.67    0.06    1.82    0.46    0.00    0.21    0.00    0.00    0.00   89.77
```


Next, to display processor numbers to all CPUs, run the command with the following flags:
```
mpstat -P ALL
```

Again, the output will probably be very different from yours:
```
Linux 5.10.0-8-amd64 (debian)   07/21/2021      _x86_64_        (2 CPU)

```


Next, to get all information, run the command with the following flag:
```
mpstat -A
```
This will display each and every detail of CPU usage.:

mpstat -P 1
