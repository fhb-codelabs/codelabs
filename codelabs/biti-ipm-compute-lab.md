# BITI IPM Lab - Compute
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Before You Begin 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
Every computer system benefits from proper administration and monitoring. A computer operates more quickly if few CPU-intensive processes are running at the same time.

Therefore, it is important to know about the CPUs, how they are used and how fast they are. Additionally, it makes sense that administrators check the CPU usage on a regular basis to identify programs that unnecessarly burden the system.

Luckily, IT administrators don't need special system information programs to find this information.There are plenty of command line utilities created for this purpose. This codelab will introduce you to some of the most helpful applications and how to use them.

###  Where You Can Look Up
The **man** is a short term for manual page and acts as an interface to view the reference manual of a command.

Syntax of man:
```
man [option(s)] keyword(s)
```

For example, if you want top find out more about the command **ps** and how to use it, just open a shell and type:
```
man ps
```

This command will display all the information about **ps**.
```
PS(1)                            User Commands                           PS(1)

NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.
...
...
```
### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian 11 (Bullseye).

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration. 

## Display CPU information on Linux


### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find detailed information about the physical CPUs (pCPU) including all cores on Linux:

* nproc command
* lscpu command
* cat /proc/cpuinfo
* hwinfo command
* dmidecode -t processor command
* getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN command


### #1. The nproc command

The **nproc** command displays the number of available processing units. The command is a built-in command in a Linux system.

Open a shell and run **nproc** with the following option:
```
echo "Threads/core: $(nproc --all)"
```

Sample output:
```
Threads/core: 4
```

<aside class="positive">
Without the --all flag, nproc will display the number of processing units available to the current process.<br>
Use the --help flag for more information.
</aside>


### #2. The lscpu command

On most Linux distributions, you can also use the **lscpu** command. It displays not only the number of processors but also the architecture, model name, speed, much more.

Open a shell and run the following command:
```
lscpu
lscpu | egrep 'Model name|Socket|Thread|NUMA|CPU\(s\)'
```

Sample outputs:

* CPU model: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz
* Socket: 1
* CPU Cores: 2
* Thread per core: 2 
* Total threads: 4

### #3. cpuinfo

All Linux distributions allows you to run **cat /proc/cpuinfo**. This file contains details about the processors installed. Note that /proc is a pseudo-filesystem, it is used as an interface to kernel data structures.

Open a shell and run the following command:
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo | more
```

Information is grouped per logical processor. That means that every processor is listed separately and various details about the CPU are included in the description.

<aside class="positive">
Consult the documentation and man-pages for more details. Try to identify keywords and details of the CPU. 
</aside>

To count the number of processing units use grep command.
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor
```

Sample outputs:
```
icinga@server:/# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor
processor	: 0
processor	: 1
processor	: 2
processor	: 3
```

Let us print cpu thread count:

```
echo "CPU threads: $(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)"
grep 'cpu cores' /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
```

Sample outputs:
```
icinga@server:/# echo "CPU threads: $(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)"
CPU threads: 4
icinga@server:/# grep 'cpu cores' /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
cpu cores	: 2
```

<aside class="positive">
The number of processors shown by /proc/cpuinfo might be different from the actual number of cores on the processor. For example a processor with 4 cores and hyperthreading would be reported as a processor with 8 cores.
</aside>

### #4. The hwinfo command

Hwinfo checks details of the hardware present in a Linux system and displays the extensive details of each hardware device. It reports information about most hardware units including CPU, HDD controllers, network card, graphics cards, and more.

<aside class="positive">
Hwinfo requires root privileges.
</aside>

```
hwinfo | more

The "--short" option will display brief information about the hardware and not the details.
With the "--cpu" option, hwinfo would display only cpu information.

```
hwinfo --short --cpu
```

Sample output

```
root@server# hwinfo --short --cpu

                       Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2463 MHz
```

Finally, the hwinfo has an option to log all data to a file. The following command will log detailed information about all hardware units to a text file.

```
hwinfo --all --log hardware_info.txt
```


### #5. The dmidecode command

The Linux command **dmidecode** reads the data from DMI (Desktop Management Interface) table which holds information for systemâ€™s hardware components like BIOS Revision, Serial Number, CPU, RAM, etc.

The tools is useful when users run into situations where they need to find out maximum RAM supported by the BIOS and motherboard, a serial number or a key piece of hardware information during troubleshooting. 

<aside class="positive">
Hwinfo requires root privileges.
</aside>

To get information about the CPU, run dmidecode with -t option as shown below:

```
dmidecode -t processor | more
```

Sample output:

```
root@server# dmidecode -t processor | more
# dmidecode 3.3

### #6. The getconf command
The Linux command **getconf** displays the value of a specified configuration variable on the standard output. The **getconf** command is most portable solution as it runs on Linux and Mac OS X as well.

The option `-a` displays all configuration variables for the current system and their values, on standard output. To get a list of all configuration variables for the current system, run the following command

```
getconf -a
```

Sample output:
```
getconf -a | more

To get the number of CPU/Cores, run the following command:
```
echo "Number of CPU/cores online at $HOSTNAME: $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)"
```

Sample output:
```

```

## CPU monitoring tools on Linux

### What you will learn:

You can use one of the following command to monitor the physical CPU cores including all cores on Linux:

* uptime command
* top program
* htop program
* mpstat command


### #1. The uptime command 

The command **uptime** shows the basic information. The Linux tool requires few system resources only and can be helpful when a system is responding slow.


Open a shell  and run the command as follows:

```
uptime
```

The output may look like this:

```
17:58:21 up 1 day, 22:38,  1 user,  load average: 0.54, 0.51, 0.69
```

The command shows :

- the system time at the moment the command was run (here: 5.58pm)
- how long the server had been running (here: 1 day)
- how many connections users had to the machine (here: 1 user)
- the CPU load average for the past one, five, and fifteen minutes (here: 0.54, 0.51, 0.69)

To see load changes on screen, run the `watch` command as follows:

```
watch uptime
```

<aside class="positive">
Consult your documentation about the CPU load average, its meaning and how to interpret the numbers.

### #2. top

One of the most common Linux tools for checking the CPU utilization is **top**. <br><br>
Like **uptime**, the command **top** displays the CPU load averages. In addition, the command provides real-time CPU usage information as well as other performance metrics. Furthermore, top stays in the foreground and refreshes at regular intervals.

Run the **top** command as follows:
```
top
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
![top](./img/biti-ipm-compute-linux-top.png)

The first five lines (also called the Header Block) provide a summary about the processes on the server. The Header Block is followed by a table  (the Process Table) with information about each individual process.

<aside class="positive">
Consult the man-pages for more details about top, about the Header Block and the Process Table. Run your own research about the output and how to interpret it.
</aside>

### #3. htop 

This tool is another interactive real-time process monitoring application for Linux. It has numerous nice user-friendly features which are not availble under the **top** command.

Unfortunately, the program is not installed by default. Run the following command to install **htop** with the privileges of the root account:
```
apt update; apt install htop
```

<aside class="positive">
If errors occur due to lack of root privilegues, check the section Prerequisites for more details. 
</aside>


After successful installation, run the **htop** command as follows:
```
htop
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
![htop](./img/biti-ipm-compute-linux-htop.png)

The top section is more easier to read and the bottom section is better organized.


<aside class="positive">
Consult the man-pages for more details about htop. Run your own research about the output and how to interpret it.
</aside>


### #4. mpstat 

The tool **mpstat** is a Linux command that is used to report processor related statistics. It displays the statistics of the CPU usage of the system and information about CPU utilization. It initializes the first processor with CPU 0, the second one with CPU 1, and so on.


The tool **mpstat** is part of the software package **sysstat**. Like **htop**, the program is not installed by default. Run the following command to install the **systat** package with the privileges of the root account:
```
apt update; apt install sysstat
```

<aside class="positive">
If errors occur, execute the command **su -** first before running the installation process. You will be prompted for the root password. Ask your instructor for the password and run the above command again. 
</aside>


After successful installation, run the **mpstat** command as follows:
```
mpstat
```

The output will probably be very different from yours:
```
Linux 5.10.0-8-amd64 (debian)   07/21/2021      _x86_64_        (2 CPU)

10:13:59 AM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal  %guest  %gnice   %idle

```


Next, to display processor numbers to all CPUs, run the command with the following flags:
```
mpstat -P ALL
```

Again, the output will probably be very different from yours:
```

```


Next, to get all information, run the command with the following flag:
```
mpstat -A
```
This will display each and every detail of CPU usage.:

## Display CPU information on Microsoft Windows

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find some information about the physical CPUs (pCPU) including all cores on Windows:

* msinfo32 command
* systeminfo command
* wmic command
* Windows Registry

### #1. msinfo32 / System Information
The tool **msinfo32** is a built-in system profiler for Microsoft Windows which collects and displays system information about the the Operating systems, hard- and software.

To launch **msinfo32**, simple press the **Win+R** keys, type **msinfo32** and click the **OK**-button.

![Windows Registry](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-msinfo32.png)

Details about the CPU can be found in the System Summary section at the Processor value in the right pane.

### #2. Systeminfo

Using this method, you can find out system information in Windows PowerShell.

* Launch Windows PowerShell as an administrator, enter the command:

```
systeminfo
```

* The Windows PowerShell window displays some information about the processor on this computer.

## Monitor the CPU on Windows

### #1. Windows Task Manager

The **Windows Task Manager (Taskmon)** is a system tool found in all versions of Microsoft Windows platform's. It provides information about running applications, processes, and services, as well as computer performance, network activity, and memory information. There are two views for the Task Manager: Simplified and Advanced.

To use Taskmon, open Start, do a search for **taskman**, and confirm the result.

![Windows Task Manager (advanced view)](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-taskman.png)


### #2. Windows Resource Monitor


The **Windows Resource Monitor (Resmon)** is a system application included in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows that allows users to look at the presence and allocation of resources on a computer.

The Windows Task Manager can best be described as a tool that runs **on** the surface. It lists processes and services, and general resource usage. In contrast, the Resource Monitor gives you the option to look **under** the surface to get more information that the Task Manager does not provide.

The Windows Resource Monitor can be used to determine extensive and detailed information about the current performance and resource consumption in real time. The program is therefore also suitable for error analysis. The view is divided into the following sections:

- Overview (CPU, disk, network, memory)
- CPU 
- Memory 
- Disk 
- Network 

To use Resmon, open Start, do a search for **resmon**, and confirm the result.

![htop](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-resmon.png)


### #3. Windows Performance Monitor (Perfmon)

On Windows 10, users can use **Windows Performance Monitor** to analyze data, such as processor, hard drive, memory, and network usage.

To use Permon, open Start, do a search for **perfmon**, and confirm the result.

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-main.png)

When you open the tool, the main page will show up with a brief overview, a system summary with real-time data about Memory, Network Interface, Physical Disk, and Processor Information. On the keft side, you will find the navigation pane with access to Monitoring Tools, Data Collector Sets, and Reports.<br>
<br>
When you switch to the Performance Monitor, you will see a screen with a single counter. This is typically the **Processor Time** counter, which displays the processor load.
<br>

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-performance.png)

However, you can add a lot of other counters to monitor virtually anything on your computer. To add new counters to monitor applications and hardware performance on your computer, do the following steps:

- Click on the green **Plus** button above the Performance Monitor graph.
- Select Local computer (or the name of your computer) from the drop-down menu.
- Select and expand the category of the item you want to monitor. 
- If applicable, select the instances you want to monitor. Click the **Add** button to add the new counters.
<br>

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-addcounter.png)

- Finally, click on the **OK** button to confirm. Here you are !

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-counteradded.png)


The Performance Monitor also includes so-called Data Collectors Sets, which is where you can use existing sets or create custom sets containing performance counters and alerts based on specific criteria.

In this lab, we will use the Data Collectors Set for Hyper-V. You can right-click your Data Collector Set under "User Defined," and click **Start** to run it.

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-start.png)

Wait 30 seconds, while **Performance Monitor** is collecting data. Then right-click the Data Collector set for Hyper-V and click on **Stop** to shut it down.

![Windows Performance Monitor](./img/biti-ipm-compute-windows-perfmon-stop.png)

The tools generates Reports for each run. To view these reports, click on the lastest Hyper-V report in the Report section and browse through the statistics.

## Hands-On: CPU Monitoring on Linux

### What you will learn:

In this codelab, you will learn 

* how to use the htop programm
* how to generate workload
* how to limit CPU time that the workload generator may consume

### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need the following tools:

* Stress
* htop
* uptime
* cpulimit

Details of these two (2) tools can be found in the corresponding Codelab named `Stress the computer`. Create workloads with Yes and/or Stress to see how the CPU responds.

For example, run the following command to create a CPU workload for 2 cores for the next two (2) minutes:
```
stress -c 2 -t 120s
```

This gives you time to run commands like htop or uptime to observe CPU usage. Remember that you can also start multiple workload generators simultaneously or delayed. This allows you to try multiple scenarios.

### Scenario

In this codelab, the target is a Virtual Machine with 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM. The operating system is based on Debian 11.0 (Bullseye) with Linux kernel version 5.10.0-8-amd64.

* Open a shell terminal and execute the following command:
```
htop
```

* Open another shell terminal and execute the following command:
```
watch uptime
```

* Open another shell terminal and start the workload generator with the following option.
```
stress -c 2
```
Notice that the workload generator runs without a time limit.

* Observe how the CPU utilization changes. 
* Sample output for **uptime**:
![Exercise](./img/biti-ipm-compute-exercise-uptime.png) 
* Sample output for **htop** 
![Exercise](./img/biti-ipm-compute-exercise-htop.png)

As you can see, the CPU Load rises above 3.0, indicating that the CPU is overloaded. At this point, we will try to limit the stress processes to 10% each.

* Get the identifiers of all stress processes. In this case the PID's are: 31210, 31211, and 31212

* Open a shell and execute the following command.
```
cpulimit -p 31210 --limit 10 &
```
Sample output
```
root@server' Process 31210 detected
```
* Repeat the command above for the PID 31211 and 31212.
* Observe how the CPU utilization changes in the two tools **htop** and **uptime**.
* Sample output for **htop**:
![Exercise](./img/biti-ipm-compute-exercise-htop-low.png)
* Sample output for **uptime**:
![Exercise](./img/biti-ipm-compute-exercise-uptime-low.png)
* As assumed, the CPU Load drops below 1.0, which means that the CPU is now able to handle all of the work scheduled in time.

To clean up, stop all running stress processes with the following command:
```
killall stress
```

Finally, you can close all open terminals. 

This is the end of the hands-on.
