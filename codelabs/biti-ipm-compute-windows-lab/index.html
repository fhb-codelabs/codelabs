      <google-codelab-step label="Windows Resource Monitor" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>Windows Resource Monitor (Resmon)</strong> is a system application included in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows that allows users to look at the presence and allocation of resources on a computer.</p>
<p>The Windows Task Manager can best be described as a tool that runs <strong>on</strong> the surface. It lists processes and services, and general resource usage. In contrast, the Resource Monitor gives you the option to look <strong>under</strong> the surface to get more information that the Task Manager does not provide.</p>
<p>The Windows Resource Monitor can be used to determine extensive and detailed information about the current performance and resource consumption in real time. The program is therefore also suitable for error analysis. The view is divided into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview (CPU, disk, network, memory)</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Disk</li>
<li>Network</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Sample code</h2>
<p>To use Resmon, open Start, do a search for <strong>resmon</strong>, and confirm the result.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Windows Performance Monitor" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>On Microsoft Windows, IT Administrators can use <strong>Windows Performance Monitor</strong> to analyze data, such as processor, hard drive, memory, and network usage.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Sample code</h2>
<p>To use Perfmon, open Start, do a search for <strong>perfmon</strong>, and confirm the result.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Windows Performance Monitor" src="img/93f6bbdc98a86e54.png"></p>
<p>When you open the tool, the main page will show up with a brief overview, a system summary with real-time data about Memory, Network Interface, Physical Disk, and Processor Information. On the keft side, you will find the navigation pane with access to Monitoring Tools, Data Collector Sets, and Reports.<br><br> When you switch to the Performance Monitor, you will see a screen with a single counter. This is typically the <strong>Processor Time</strong> counter, which displays the processor load. <br></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Windows Performance Monitor" src="img/2bc94c09c5f2d32f.png"></p>
<p>However, you can add a lot of other counters to monitor virtually anything on your computer. To add new counters to monitor applications and hardware performance on your computer, do the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the green <strong>Plus</strong> button above the Performance Monitor graph.</li>
<li>Select Local computer (or the name of your computer) from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select and expand the category of the item you want to monitor.</li>
