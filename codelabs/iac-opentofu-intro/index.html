<p>In this lab, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install OpenTofu</li>
<li>Provision a SKS Cluster</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/" target="_blank">OpenTofu CLI</a></li>
<li>IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code) with Terraform Plugin installed</li>
<li>SSH Client installed (OpenSSH, PuTTY)</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Install OpenTofu" duration="0">
        <p>In the future, it will be more comfortable if you&#39;re able to use terraform from your PC and IDE.</p>
<p>To install OpenTofu, refer to the respective documentation here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/" target="_blank">https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please ensure, that the OpenTofu binary is in your path!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows" target="_blank">https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows</a></li>
<li>In Linux or MacOS, append the path you&#39;ve chosen to your path variable (if the package installer didn&#39;t take care about this).</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p> OpenTofu is a single binary, therefore it is very handy to install and will not make any modifications on your system. As you might want to use your IDE, it is recommended to run OpenTofu directly on your machine instead of a virtual machine.  If you want to do so, please ensure that you have a proper IDE running in your virtual machine. </p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Check if OpenTofu is installed properly</h2>
<p>To check if terraform is installed and as accessible, open a shell and run: <code>tofu version</code>. This should return the version of OpenTofu. If not and you changed the PATH before, ensure that you restarted your terminal and the Terraform Binary is located in a directory which is accessible there.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Exoscale Basics" duration="0">
        <p>Exoscale is a European Cloud Provider, which provides services as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute (Virtual Machines)</li>
<li>Kubernetes (SKS)</li>
<li>Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)</li>
<li>Object Storage (S3 Compatible)</li>
</ul>
<p>During this lab, we will deal with virtual instances and object storage. In the first step, we will provision a virtual machine there.</p>
<p>You can log in to the Exoscale Console <a href="https://portal.exoscale.com/login" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Infrastructure-as-Code" duration="0">
        <p>There are many steps to get infrastructure working when doing this manually This would be fairly enough to try out some new things, but in the real world you might want to do this in a more reproducible and scalable way.</p>
<p>This is where Infrastructure-as-Code comes into play. When you are provisioning 100s of instances, you might not want to click through the consoles for every one you are provisioning. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) gives you the possibility to configure your instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>As code</li>
<li>In a declarative way</li>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>With development best practices in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s take a closer look on all of this.</p>
<p><em>&#34;Infrastructure-as-Code is an approach to infrastructure-automation based on practices from software development. It emphasizes consisten, repeatable routines for provisioning and changing systems and their configuration. You make changes to code, then use automation to tsest and apply those changes to your systems. (Kief Morris(2020), Infrastructure-as-Code, 2nd Edition)&#34;</em></p>
<p>When we&#39;re talking about Infrastructure-as-Code, we are no more creating our Infrastructure via the UI (ClickOps). Instead, we are writing Code, mainly in a declarative way to describe the state, we want our Infrastructure to be in after it is applied.</p>
<p>Declarative configuration means that you express your intention (desired state), and a tool takes care of transitioning the managed objects to this state. Using imperative language, you would tell the tooling what it should do. You can distinguish between these two styles using the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative: Dear Tool, execute command A, B and C</li>
<li>Declarative: Dear Tool, please transition my infrastructure to exactly this state</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, that each declarative tool, will have some kind of imperative logic in it to transition to the state.</p>
<p>When we&#39;re provisioning Infrastructure-as-Code, we often have the possibility to modularize components, as well as having mechanisms in there, which help us creating multiple, similar objects. This are practices, we know from typical software development. As we are using practices from Software Development, we should also treat our Infrastructure as such. Therefore, the code should be versioned, there should be automatic tests in place and pull requests should be on the order of the day.</p>
<p>There are many tools out there for Infrastructure-as-Code like:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenTofu/Terraform</li>
<li>Pulumi</li>
<li>Crossplane</li>
</ul>
<p>Which tool you use, often depends on your own preferences and your use-cases. In this lab, we will take a closer look on OpenTofu.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="OpenTofu" duration="0">
        <p>Before we will start with our first configuration, we will put some light on OpenTofu.</p>
<p>OpenTofu is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool forked from Terraform which was initially developed by Hashicorp. It uses a declarative language to describe infrastructure. The language used is the &#34;Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)&#34;. It is designed to work with many cloud providers. Nevertheless, it is not really cloud-agnostic as knowledge about the individual providers is needed when writing the code.</p>
<p>To start using OpenTofu, we should be familiar with the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State:</strong> The current configuration of our managed resources. The state can be stored in the local filesystem (terraform.tfstate), or remote backends, as S3 Buckets or consul</li>
<li><strong>Provider:</strong> Implements the commands needed to communicate with the cloud provider. e.g. an Exoscale provider knows how to talk to the Exoscale API and how to get from one state to another.</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> The Objects you are creating and managing with OpenTofu. As an example, a virtual machine is a resource.</li>
<li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Describe objects we can query (!= write) in OpenTofu. In amazon, the AMIs (Amazon Machine Images / Templates) are implemented as datasources you can query</li>
<li><strong>Variables:</strong> Give us the possibility to parametrize terraform configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this lab, we will use a local state, Exoscale as provider and a Compute resource to create our Virtual Machine.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Provisioning an SKS Cluster on Exoscale with OpenTofu" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Goal:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to provision a very simple Kubernetes Cluster using OpenTofu</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Task:</h2>
<p>Your Boss heard about a new technique to provision Kubernetes Clusters and that Cloud Providers provide managed kubernetes Services. He tells you that you should get familiar with this and provision a SKS Cluster using OpenTofu</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Checklist:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] SKS Cluster is provisioned</li>
<li>[ ] You are able to connect to the SKS Cluster using kubectl</li>

<h2 is-upgraded>Creating an API Key and Secret for Exoscale</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the Exoscale Console</li>
<li>Click on &#34;IAM&#34; -&gt; &#34;API KEYS&#34;</li>
<li>Add Key <ul>

<ul>
<li>Create a file called <code>versions.tf</code> in your directory</li>
<li>Copy the following block in the file, replace key and secret with your API secrets</li>
<li><strong>Warning! When doing this on production environments (and in the next Labs), never store the secrets in this file, Instead, use mechanisms supported by the provider (e.g. Environment Variables)</strong></li>

You may now begin working with OpenTofu. Try running &#34;tofu plan&#34; to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All OpenTofu commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for OpenTofu,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

      <google-codelab-step label="Creating an SKS Cluster" duration="0">
        <p>Now we want to create an SKS Cluster with OpenTofu. To do so, we will create a new file called <code>sks.tf</code> and copy the following configuration in it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-terraform" class="language-terraform">locals {
  zone = &#34;at-vie-2&#34;
}

resource &#34;exoscale_sks_cluster&#34; &#34;my_sks_cluster&#34; {
   zone = local.zone
   name = &#34;my-sks-cluster&#34;
   cni = &#34;cilium&#34;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>locals</code> block defines a local variable named <code>zone</code> with a value of <code>"at-vie-2"</code>. Local variables are convenient to avoid hardcoding values multiple times in the configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>resource</code> block defines a resource of type <code>exoscale_sks_cluster</code> named <code>my_sks_cluster</code>. This resource represents an SKS (Simple Kubernetes Service) cluster on Exoscale, a cloud provider.</p>
<p>The <code>zone</code> attribute of the <code>exoscale_sks_cluster</code> resource is set to the local variable <code>zone</code>, which means the SKS cluster will be created in the <code>"at-vie-2"</code> zone.</p>
<p>The <code>name</code> attribute is set to <code>"my-sks-cluster"</code>, which will be the name of the SKS cluster.</p>
<p>The <code>cni</code> attribute is set to <code>"cilium"</code>, which specifies that the Cilium CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin will be used for networking in the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>After saving the configuration, run <code>tofu init</code> to initialize the directory and download the Exoscale provider.</p>
<p>Then run <code>tofu   plan</code> to see what changes will be applied to the infrastructure. You should see the following output:</p>
