# BITI IPM Lab - Network

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Before You Begin

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this codelab you will learn

- how to get information about local network devices
- how to monitor networks using Linux tools
- how to check network performance

### Where You Can Look Up

The **man** is a short term for manual page and acts as an interface to view the reference manual of a command.

Syntax of man:

```
man [option(s)] keyword(s)
```

For example, if you want top find out more about the command **ps** and how to use it, just open a shell and type:

```
man ps
```

This command will display all the information about **ps**.

```
PS(1)                            User Commands                           PS(1)

NAME
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
       you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use top(1) instead.
...
...
```

### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian .

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration.

## Device information

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find detailed information about the physical or virtual network devices on Linux:

- lspci
- hwinfo
- ip
- nmcli

## lscpi

### Description

The **lspci** command is a utility on linux systems used to find out information about the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) busses and devices connected to the PCI subsystem.

### Sample code

To list all PCI devices, run the following command:

```
lspci
```

### Sample output

```
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440FX - 82441FX PMC [Natoma] (rev 02)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82371SB PIIX3 ISA [Natoma/Triton II]

00:0d.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801HM/HEM (ICH8M/ICH8M-E) SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 02)
```

The list shows the model of the Ethernet controller, but not the network device interfaces. For this we need another tool.

### References

Need help? Use this:

```
man lspci

## hwinfo

### Description

The tool **hwinfo** checks details of the hardware present in a Linux system and displays the extensive details of each hardware device. It reports information about most hardware units including network controller and network cards.

<aside class="positive">
Hwinfo requires root privileges.
</aside>

### Sample code

Run the following command:

```
hwinfo
```

### Sample output

## ip

### Description

The `ip` command is one of the basic commands every administrator will need in daily work, from setting up new systems and assigning IPs to troubleshooting existing systems. The `ip` command can show address information, manipulate routing, plus display network various devices, interfaces, and tunnels.

### Sample code

To show the IP addresses assigned to an interface on your server:

```
ip address show
```

### Sample output

The output will look different from yours:

```

## nmcli

### Description

**nmcli** is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network status. The tool is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate network connections, as well as control and display network device status.

### Sample code

Open a shell and run the command twice but with different options each time:

```
nmcli device show
nmcli connection show
```

### Sample output

Here is an example of both outputs:

```

## Network measurement

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following commands to find detailed information about the physical or virtual network devices on Linux:

- ping
- speedtest
- iperf3 (has been moved to the section `Hands-On`)

## ping

### Description

The **ping** command is one of the most used tools for diagnosing network connectivity issues.

**Ping** works by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packages to a specified destination IP on the network and waits for a reply. When the destination receives the package, it responds with an ICMP echo reply.

With the **ping** command, IT Administrators can determine whether a remote destination IP is active or inactive. IT Administrators can also find the round-trip delay in communicating with the destination and check whether there is a packet loss.

<aside class="positive">
Ping is not sufficient for determining service availability. Instead, check your UDP/TCP port directly, to see if the service is still available.
</aside>

### Sample code

```
ping -c 3 www.orf.at
```

Where,

- -c 3 - Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets
- www.orf.at - the target

### Sample output

```
PING www.orf.at (194.232.104.140) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from www.orf.at (194.232.104.140): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=57.9 ms
64 bytes from www.orf.at (194.232.104.140): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms
64 bytes from www.orf.at (194.232.104.140): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=21.2 ms

--- www.orf.at ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 21.228/34.314/57.876/16.694 ms
```

Where,

- The number of data bytes. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes - 64 bytes.
- The IP address of the destination - from www.orf.at (194.232.104.140).
- The ICMP sequence number for each packet. icmp_seq=1.
- The Time to Live. - ttl=53 - How does TTL work?.
- The ping time, measured in milliseconds which is the round trip time for the packet to reach the host, and the response to return to the sender. - time=21.2 ms.

### References

Ping the man:

```
man ping
```

## speedtest-cli

### Description

One of the most famous online internet connection test apps is speedtest.net. The tool **speedtest-cli** is a command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net. The test is simple to use and provides multiple options. To view all of them, pass the `-h` flag to display the speedtest-cli help file.

### Sample code

To run the tool, simple execute the command without options.

```
speedtest-cli
```

### Sample output

```

## Network monitoring

### What You will learn:

You can use one of the following tools to find detailed information about the network traffic:

- iftop
- etherape
- monitorix

## iftop

### Description

**iftop** is a real time console-based Linux network bandwidth monitoring tool. It shows a quick overview of the networking activities on an interface. It even acts as a diagnostics to diagnose which program is causing the problem to the network.

### Sample code

Run the command as follows:

```
iftop
```

To view the network bandwidth of a particular interface, use the following command.

```
iftop -i enp0s3
```

<aside class="positive">
Keep in mind the difference between eth0 and enp0s3. 
</aside>

### Sample output

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-iftop.png)

Where,

- At the very top of the screen is a scale that goes along with the bar graph iftop might display with each connection.
- The next rows of output correspond to each network connection between a pair of hosts. In between the two hosts are arrows that let you know the direction the traffic is flowing.
- The final three columns provide average bandwidth for each connection during the last 2, 10 and 40 seconds, respectively.

### References

Here is the link to the documentation:

```
man iftop
```

## etherape

### Description

**Etherape** is a graphical tool that provides a view of current network activity. Current connections are displayed thicker than passive connections depending on the volume transferred.

**Etherape** supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP, SLIP and WLAN devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read packets from a file as well as live from the network. Node statistics can be exported.

### Sample code

To start Etherape, run the following command with root privileges:

```
sudo etherape
```

### Sample output

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-etherape.png)

In contrast to other network monitors, Etherape visualizes the logged connections in a graphical representation. The approach of the open source program is intuitive: Each IP address is graphically represented as a node, connection lines trace the transmitted data. The thickness of the lines shows the data volume of the corresponding connection between the nodes and the color of the lines shows the protocol used in each case.

## monitorix

### Description

Monitorix is an open source, free and most powerful lightweight tool designed to monitor system and network resources in Linux. It regularly collects system and network data and display the information in graphs using its own web interface. Monitorix allows to monitor overall system performance and also help in detecting bottlenecks, failures, unwanted long response times and other abnormal activities.

Monitorix has a rich set of features some of them are listed below:

- System load average and usage
- Per-processor kernel usage
- Global kernel usage
- Generic sensors statistics
- LM-Sensors and GPU temperatures
- NVIDIA temperatures and usage
- Filesystem usage and I/O activity
- Network traffic and usage

Documentation and more details of Monitorix can be found [here](https://www.monitorix.org/).

### Sample code

Typically, monitorix is running as a service in the backgrund. You can check this by running the following command:

```
sudo systemctl status monitorix
```

You should see the following result, indicating the active status as `running`

```
  monitorix.service - Monitorix

```

### Sample output

Start a browser which points to the following URL:

```
http://<ip-address>:8080/monitorix
```

Where

- ip-address - The server's IP address or it's hostname.

Monitorix offers a wide range of performance counters. However, in this codelab we are interested in networking. Therefore select the Graph `enps03 Network traffic` from the Host `localhost`.

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-monitorix-1.png)

After clicking on the OK button, monitorix will show up the **Netstat statistic**. By default, the page refreshes automatically every 150 seconds, displaying the network activity, packetes and errors.

## cockpit

### Description

Cockpit is another server management tool. It is easy to use, lightweight and simple, yet very powerful. It provides a web-based user interface that facilitates storage management tasks, starting / stopping services, checking journals and setup management for multiple servers.

The tool was created for Red Hat, but runs on many Linux server distributions in addition to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): Fedora, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS and others.

### Sample output

To access the Cockpit interface, just point your browser to the following URL:

```
http://<ip-address>:9090/
```

Where

- ip-address - The server's IP address or it's hostname.

<aside class="negative">
Please note that Cockpit is installed on a virtual machine, which is only used within the course. Always make sure that you secure the http connection.
</aside>

Log in with a normal account. Hoyever, it might be a good idea for this account to have root privileges.

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-cockpit-1.png)

The Dashboard view is clean and uncluttered. The image below shows a card layout. It graphs CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O. If this is your first run and you haven't yet connected any servers, you will see graphs for the local system only.

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-cockpit-2.png)

The Networking section allows you to manage firewall and network interfaces. You can edit firewall rules and zones and manipulate networking with bonding, teaming, bridges, and VLANs.

![itop](./img/biti-ipm-network-linux-cockpit-3.png)

In this codelab, you will learn

- how to use the iperf3 programm
- how to generate workload with iperf3

### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need the following tools:

- iperf3

### Scenario

In this codelab, the GuestOS is a Virtual Machine with 2 CPU Cores and 4 GB RAM. The GuestOS is based on Debian with Linux kernel version 5.10.0-8-amd64. The VM is installed and running on the Linux-based Hypervisor VirtualBox, Version 6.1.16 r140961 (QT 5.11.3). The HostOS is based on Debian with Linux Kernel version 4.19.0-17-amd64. The Host hardware is HP Prodesk 400 G1 DN with a Intel Core i3-4160T CPU@3.10GHz, 16GB RAM, and an Intenso SATA III Top 512GB.

### Test Run

To start the server, run iperf3 on the HostOS with the following option:

```
iperf3 -s
```

Where,

- -s - Run iperf3 in server mode. iperf3 can handle multiple client requests.

To start the client, run iperf3 on the GuestOS with the following option by specifying the server's ip address

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.7.187
```

Where,

- -s 192.168.7.11 - Run iperf3 in client mode, connecting to an iperf3 server running on host with IP 192.168.10.2.

### Sample output

iperf3 server's output:

```
