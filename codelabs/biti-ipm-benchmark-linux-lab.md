# BITI IPM Lab - Benchmark
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Before You Begin 

The Phoronix Test Suite is a comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for the Linux operating system. This software is designed to carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean, reproducible, and easy-to-use manner.  It consists of a lightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark consisting of an XML-based profile with related resource scripts. 

The Phoronix Test Suite contains profiles for various individual tests, whereby only external programs are used. When a test is started for the first time, the required programs and data are automatically downloaded from the network and stored in the directory ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests. Within the Phoronix Test Suite single tests are called benchmarks, whereas combinations of single tests are called suites.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn
In this codelab you will learn

* the Phoronix Test Suite
* how to perform a benchmark run

###  Where You Can Look Up

Documentation about the Phoronix Test Suite can be found [here](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com).


### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian 11 (Bullseye).

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users will therefore be different from the Host's user administration. 


## Installation

### Description

First you need to acquire the installation package. One option is to go to the [Phoronix download page](http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/?k=downloads), and pick a version. Then you can download it to the machine that will be running the tests.

After the download, run the install process:

```
sudo dpkg -i phoronix-test-suite_10.6.1_all.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

Once the software suite is installed, run it for the first time. It will ask you a couple of questions and then show you the User Agreement License (UAL):

```
phoronix-test-suite
```

Note, that you have to accept the terms, but do not enable anonymus usage.

```
Do you agree to these terms and wish to proceed (y/n): Y
Enable anonymous usage / statistics reporting (y/n): N
```

<aside class="negative">
Do no enable anonymus usage.

You can get information on a particular test or suite:

```
phoronix-test-suite info [test]
```

When you know what test or tests you want to run, you need to install the test dependencies before you can run them.

You can run the install in a separate operation. The following command will install the `Java test suite`:

```
phoronix-test-suite install pts/java
```

Now can get information on `pts/java` suite:

```
phoronix-test-suite info pts/java
```

The command above will show you core information about the phoronix-test-suite package:

```

To run the benchmark, execute the following command
```
phoronix-test-suite run pts/java
```
Or you can invoke benchmark which will first install and then run the tests for you.

```
phoronix-test-suite benchmark pts/java
```

<aside class="positive">
You can run each test individually, or several at a time. Whether you run one test or multiple, you can run them in interactive mode or batch mode. Batch mode is great if you want to run many tests without babysitting.

## Hands-On

### What you will learn:

In this codelab, you will learn 

* how to use the phoronix-test-suite
* how to execute a benchmark run
* how to read the results


### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need the following tools:

* phoronix-test-suite



Details of these two (2) tools can be found in the corresponding Codelab named `Benchmark`. 

### Scenario

In this codelab, the GuestOS is a Virtual Machine with 2 CPU Cores and 4 GB RAM. The GuestOS is based on Debian 11.0 (Bullseye) with Linux kernel version 5.10.0-8-amd64. The VM is installed and running on the Linux-based Hypervisor VirtualBox, Version 6.1.16 r140961 (QT 5.11.3). THe HostOS is based on Debian 10 (Buster) with Linux Kernel version 4.19.0-17-amd64. The Host hardware is HP Prodesk 400 G1 DN with a Intel Core i3-4160T CPU@3.10GHz, 16GB RAM, and an Intenso SATA III Top 512GB.

### Test Run


Open a shell terminal and execute the following command:
```
phoronix-test-suite run pts/sysbench-1.0.0
```

First, phoronox will show you a list of new or updated tests. In most cases, you can simple ignore this output.

Current Description: Oracle VirtualBox testing on Debian 11 via the Phoronix Test Suite.

New Description: 

        [Performance Tip] The powersave CPU scaling governor is currently
        in use. It's possible to obtain greater performance if using the
        performance governor.

        To change behavior, run: 

        echo performance | tee
        /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

        Reference:
        https://openbenchmarking.org/result/1706268-TR-CPUGOVERN32


        To stop showing performance tips, run: phoronix-test-suite
        unload-module perf_tips

        Continuing in 5 seconds or press CTRL-C to stop the testing
        process.

```

Next, Phoronix will start the test run. As show, the test run should be completed after 9 minutes, depending on your hardware performance.

### Clean Up

* To clean up and save disk space, remove the hidden `phoronix-test-suite` directory:
```
rm -r /home/icinga/.phoronix-test-suite
```

* Finally, you can close all open terminals. 

This is the end of the hands-on.
