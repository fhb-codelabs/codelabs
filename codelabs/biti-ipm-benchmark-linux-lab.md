# BITI IPM Lab - Benchmark

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Before You Begin

The Phoronix Test Suite is a comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for the Linux operating system. This software is designed to carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean, reproducible, and easy-to-use manner. It consists of a lightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark consisting of an XML-based profile with related resource scripts.

The Phoronix Test Suite contains profiles for various individual tests, whereby only external programs are used. When a test is started for the first time, the required programs and data are automatically downloaded from the network and stored in the directory ~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests. Within the Phoronix Test Suite single tests are called benchmarks, whereas combinations of single tests are called suites.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this codelab you will learn

- the Phoronix Test Suite
- how to perform a benchmark run

### Where You Can Look Up

Documentation about the Phoronix Test Suite can be found [here](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com).

### What You'll need

#### Guest operation system (Guest OS)

This is the OS of the virtual machine. This will be Debian .

#### Administators privileges

By default, administrator privileges are required on the Host OS to install additional software. Make sure that you have the required permissions.

For the Guest OS, you will create and manage your own users. These users are therefore be different from the Host's user administration.

## Installation

### Description

First, you need to download and install the installation package. Go to the [Phoronix download page](http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/?k=downloads) and download the `Ubuntu/Debian Package` to the computer which you want to run the tests.

Next, run the install process by executing the following two (2) commands:

```
sudo dpkg -i phoronix-test-suite_10.6.1_all.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

Once the software suite is installed, go ahead and start the program: 

```
phoronix-test-suite
```

You will be asked a couple of questions. Finally, the program will display the User Agreement License (UAL). Note, that you have to accept the terms, but do not enable anonymus usage.

```
Do you agree to these terms and wish to proceed (y/n): Y
Enable anonymous usage / statistics reporting (y/n): N
```

<aside class="negative">
Again: Do not enable anonymus usage.

```

Run the following command to obtain detailed information on a specific test:

```
phoronix-test-suite info [test]
```

If you know (or have been told) which test you want to run, you must first install the test dependencies before you can run it. The following example will install the Java test suite:

```
phoronix-test-suite install pts/java
```

Again, if you want to know more on `pts/java`, run the following command:

```
phoronix-test-suite info pts/java
```

The command above will show you core information about the `pts/java` suite. Section `Contained Tests` will list all tests that are included in this suite.

```

To run the benchmark, just execute the following command:

```
phoronix-test-suite run pts/java
```

<aside class="positive">
You can perform each test individually or several at once. Regardless of whether you run one or more tests, you can run them in interactive mode or batch mode. Batch mode is ideal if you want to run many tests without babysitting.
</aside>

## Hands-On

### What you will learn:

In this codelab, you will learn

- how to use the phoronix-test-suite
- how to execute a benchmark run
- how to read the results

### What you will need:

In this codelab, you will need the following tool:

- phoronix-test-suite

### What you are not allowed to do:

This practical exercise will use the test suite `pts/sysbench-1.0.0` for demonstration purposes. You will need to use a different test suite for your assignment, okay?

<aside class="negative">
Do not use this test suite for your work. You have to choose your own test.
</aside>

### Scenario

In this Codelab, the GuestOS is a virtual machine with 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM. The guest operating system is based on Debian with Linux kernel version 5.10.0-8-amd64. The VM runs on the Linux-based hypervisor VirtualBox, version 6.1.16 r140961 (QT 5.11.3). The HostOS is based on Debian with Linux kernel version 4.19.0-17-amd64. The host hardware is an HP Prodesk 400 G1 DN with an Intel Core i3-4160T CPU@3.10GHz, 16GB RAM and an Intenso SATA III Top 512GB.

### Test Run

Open a shell terminal and run the following command:

```
phoronix-test-suite run pts/sysbench-1.0.0
```

First, phoronox will show you a list of new or updated tests. In most cases, you can simple ignore this output.

New Description:

        [Performance Tip] The powersave CPU scaling governor is currently
        in use. It's possible to obtain greater performance if using the
        performance governor.

        To change behavior, run:

        echo performance | tee
        /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

        Reference:
        https://openbenchmarking.org/result/1706268-TR-CPUGOVERN32


        To stop showing performance tips, run: phoronix-test-suite

        Continuing in 5 seconds or press CTRL-C to stop the testing
        process.

```

Next, Phoronix will start the test run. As shown, the test run should be completed after 9 minutes, depending on your hardware performance.
